# Introduction

This project has an idea developed in the Pi Week (8th edition 13-17 July, 2015 http://piweek.com/). The scope of this event is create an appliction in one week using open source tools.

Most of the existing webpages for the sharing of 3D models aren't real open source. We also want to allow users to keep track of their files and the changes that they make, providing the benefits of Git, but without needing technical knowledge.

# Technologies

The tools is developed using Java (JDK7), Vaadin, Git as files repository and other tools. 

# Objectives
The objectives of this project are: 
* Upload of binary and ascii STL files.
* Binaryfiles are converted to ascii before being pushed to Git
* Creation of new projects.
* Fork of other user projects.
* Upload and version control of new components.
* 3D rendering of STL files.
